Amagama documentation
=====================

Amagama is a web service implementing a large-scale translation memory. A translation
memory is a database of previous transaltions which can be searched to find good
matches to new strings.

Amagama is implemented in Python on top of PostgreSQL. There are currently no releases
of the software, but `source code is available <https://github.com/translate/amagama>`_.

A a public deployment of Amagama is available and is usable from `Virtaal
<http://virtaal.org>`_ and the development version of `Pootle
<http://pootle.translatehouse.org>`_.

If you are able to help with extra hosting, even if just for specific
languages, please contact the project developers.
